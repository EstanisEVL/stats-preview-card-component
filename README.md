## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS/SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned to import fonts from Google Fonts directly into my project. Also I learned to create an overlay to modify the header image's color.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on element sizes in future projects to achieve more precise layout designs, so I can replicate the designs provided faster and more efficiently.
